# Bank Blockchain ERP System

Written by Justin Huang

## Instructions

* Unzip or clone the folder with the ERP system
* Make sure you're using Flask and Requests
    * If using a virtualenv, go ahead and install the libraries in the virtual environment
    * If using pipenv, a Pipfile has been provided for installation
* Run `python3 bank_erp.py` in a terminal within the same folder
* The API should begin running, and you can test out different endpoints in a web browser or using Postman
    * Refer to the included project specs sheet documentation for a list of endpoints

## Troubleshooting

* If there's a problem with the imports, go into all the folders in `src` and remove the "." in front of the relative imports. However, this issue should be fixed already.
